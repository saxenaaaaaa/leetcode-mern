# leetcode-mern

This is a practice project to build backend of a website. It is an illustration of MERN stack, hence it uses - 
 
  1. Typegoose (typescript-ified mongoose) as ODM
  2. Express for backend Server.
  3. NodeJS as runtime.

In this project, I have built a simpler version of Leetcode APIs, where different users can signin and submit problems. The intent is to showcase usage of MERN stack and not build a full-fledged leetcode.
